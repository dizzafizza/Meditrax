   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Meditrax.git
   cd Meditrax
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the web assets**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Development

#### Web Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

#### iOS Development
```bash
# Build and sync to iOS
npm run build:mobile

# Open in Xcode
npm run cap:ios

# Or use the combined script
npm run ios:dev
```

Then build and run from Xcode to test on simulator or device.

#### Android Development
```bash
# Build and sync to Android
npm run build:mobile

# Open in Android Studio
npm run cap:android

# Or use the combined script
npm run android:dev
```

Then build and run from Android Studio to test on emulator or device.

#### Desktop (Electron) Development
```bash
# Build and sync to Electron
npm run build:mobile

# Open Electron app
npm run cap:electron

# Or use the combined script
npm run electron:dev
```

### Building for Production

#### iOS
1. Open the project in Xcode: `npm run cap:ios`
2. Configure signing & capabilities
3. Archive and distribute to App Store or TestFlight

#### Android
1. Open the project in Android Studio: `npm run cap:android`
2. Generate a signed APK or AAB
3. Distribute via Google Play Store

#### Desktop
1. Navigate to the electron directory: `cd electron`
2. Build using electron-builder:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run dist
   ```
3. Find distributables in `electron/dist/`

### Web Deployment (GitHub Pages)
```bash
# Build PWA for web
npm run build:web

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy

# Or do both
npm run predeploy && npm run deploy
```

The app is available at:
- Production: https://www.meditrax.ca/
- GitHub Pages: https://yourusername.github.io/Meditrax/

**PWA Features:**
- Offline functionality via service worker
- Install to home screen
- Push notifications (web browsers)
- Local data storage
- Faster loading and app-like experience
- Integrates with your device's notification system

#### iOS Offline Usage Notes
- Open the app once while online after installing to allow the service worker to fully install and cache the app shell.
- After that, you can launch the app from the Home Screen with no connectivity.
- If you see a blank page when completely offline, force close and relaunch; iOS can be aggressive about suspending service workers.
- The app now avoids loading optional scripts during service worker startup to ensure offline launch reliability on iOS.

#### Offline & Update Behavior
- On first visit while online, the service worker installs and caches the app shell for offline use.
- Subsequent launches work fully offline. If the network is unavailable, cached assets load immediately.
- When a new deployment is available, you'll be prompted to update. Accepting will activate the new version and reload the app.
- The service worker uses a network-first strategy for HTML/JS/CSS to get fresh content when online, with fast fallback to cache when offline.

### Quick Start
For first-time users:
1. **Enable Notifications**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Notifications and enable push notifications
2. **Install as PWA**: Install the app on your device for the best experience
3. **Add Medications**: Use the "Add Medication" button to create your first entries
4. **Set Up Reminders**: Configure notification schedules for each medication
5. **Test Notifications**: Use the test button in settings to verify notifications work
6. **Explore Dashboard**: Monitor your adherence and upcoming doses
7. **Calendar View**: See your complete medication schedule
8. **Advanced Features**: Explore Cyclic Dosing for complex schedules

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The production build will be available in the `dist` directory.

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application uses client-side storage by default. For production deployments, configure:
- API endpoints (if adding backend integration)
- Analytics tracking IDs
- Notification service keys

#### Web Push (iOS/ Safari) and FCM Setup

To deliver notifications reliably on iOS PWAs, enable standard Web Push alongside FCM:

1) Get VAPID keys (one-time):
- Recommended: In Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Cloud Messaging ‚Üí Web Push certificates, click "Generate key pair". Copy both Public and Private keys.
- Or generate your own pair:
```bash
npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
```
Either pair works for standard Web Push and FCM Web; reusing Firebase‚Äôs pair keeps one set of keys.

2) Configure Cloud Functions secrets (preferred) or env vars:
```bash
# Using Firebase Functions config
firebase functions:config:set webpush.vapid_public_key="<PUBLIC_KEY>" webpush.vapid_private_key="<PRIVATE_KEY>" webpush.contact_email="mailto:notifications@meditrax.ca"

# Or set env for local emulators
export WEB_PUSH_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY="<PUBLIC_KEY>"
export WEB_PUSH_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY="<PRIVATE_KEY>"
export WEB_PUSH_CONTACT_EMAIL="mailto:notifications@meditrax.ca"
```

3) Frontend env (.env):
```bash
# Firebase (used for FCM + callable functions)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...

# Web Push VAPID public key used for PushManager.subscribe
# You can re-use the same PUBLIC key as above
VITE_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY=<PUBLIC_KEY>

# Optional gates to enable background features
# Enable initializing Firebase Messaging inside the service worker (prod recommended)
VITE_ENABLE_SW_FIREBASE=true
# Enable anonymous Firebase Auth for backend scheduling (optional)
VITE_ENABLE_BACKEND_AUTH=true
```

4) Deploy functions after setting config:
```bash
cd functions && npm run deploy
```

Notes:
- FCM may not deliver to iOS Safari PWAs on some versions. Web Push ensures delivery on iOS (iOS 16.4+ and installed to Home Screen).
- The app will use FCM where supported (Android/desktop Chromium) and Web Push where needed (iOS/Safari).

### Inventory Units and Compatibility

- For single-inventory medications with discrete units (e.g., `capsules`) and weight-based dosing (e.g., `g` or `mg`), add a single `pillConfiguration` with the per-unit strength (e.g., `500 mg`). The app will bridge mass‚Üîdiscrete automatically for inventory updates and predictions.
- For multi-pill medications, define `pillConfigurations` and a default `doseConfiguration`; predictions use mg-based math accounting for cyclic dosing and tapering.
- Powder units (e.g., `g powder`) are treated as mass units and work with the mg-based inventory math.

### Customization
- **Colors**: Modify `tailwind.config.js` for brand colors
- **Themes**: Extend theme options in the settings page
- **Medication Categories**: Update `types/index.ts` for custom categories
