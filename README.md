# üè• Meditrax - Comprehensive Medication Tracking App

A modern, responsive web application built with React and TypeScript for tracking medications, managing schedules, and monitoring adherence.

## üêûüîß Known Notes:
- **Tapering System:** Sometimes you may get an incorrect dosage. *WIP*
- **iOS PWA Push Notifications:** Fully supported via Web Push (VAPID) and/or FCM once environment variables are configured. See "Web Push (iOS/ Safari) and FCM Setup" below. If env keys are missing, the app falls back to local SW scheduling with missed‚Äëdose recovery.
- **App Updates Automatically:** The app now auto-detects new versions and prompts to reload. If you still see stale content, perform a hard refresh once.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Meditrax.git
   cd Meditrax
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### PWA Installation

Meditrax can be installed as a Progressive Web App for the best mobile experience:

**On Mobile (iOS/Android):**
1. Open the app in your browser (Safari on iOS, Chrome on Android)
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App" option
3. Follow the prompts to install
4. Access the app from your home screen like any native app

**On Desktop:**
1. Open the app in Chrome, Edge, or Safari
2. Look for the install icon in the address bar
3. Click "Install" to add to your desktop/applications
4. Launch like any desktop application

**Benefits of PWA Installation:**
- Receive push notifications for medication reminders
- Works offline with cached data
- Faster loading and app-like experience
- Integrates with your device's notification system

#### iOS Offline Usage Notes
- Open the app once while online after installing to allow the service worker to fully install and cache the app shell.
- After that, you can launch the app from the Home Screen with no connectivity.
- If you see a blank page when completely offline, force close and relaunch; iOS can be aggressive about suspending service workers.
- The app now avoids loading optional scripts during service worker startup to ensure offline launch reliability on iOS.

#### Offline & Update Behavior
- On first visit while online, the service worker installs and caches the app shell for offline use.
- Subsequent launches work fully offline. If the network is unavailable, cached assets load immediately.
- When a new deployment is available, you'll be prompted to update. Accepting will activate the new version and reload the app.
- The service worker uses a network-first strategy for HTML/JS/CSS to get fresh content when online, with fast fallback to cache when offline.

### Quick Start
For first-time users:
1. **Enable Notifications**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Notifications and enable push notifications
2. **Install as PWA**: Install the app on your device for the best experience
3. **Add Medications**: Use the "Add Medication" button to create your first entries
4. **Set Up Reminders**: Configure notification schedules for each medication
5. **Test Notifications**: Use the test button in settings to verify notifications work
6. **Explore Dashboard**: Monitor your adherence and upcoming doses
7. **Calendar View**: See your complete medication schedule
8. **Advanced Features**: Explore Cyclic Dosing for complex schedules

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application uses client-side storage by default. For production deployments, configure:
- API endpoints (if adding backend integration)
- Analytics tracking IDs
- Notification service keys

#### Web Push (iOS/ Safari) and FCM Setup

To deliver notifications reliably on iOS PWAs, enable standard Web Push alongside FCM:

1) Get VAPID keys (one-time):
- Recommended: In Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Cloud Messaging ‚Üí Web Push certificates, click "Generate key pair". Copy both Public and Private keys.
- Or generate your own pair:
```bash
npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
```
Either pair works for standard Web Push and FCM Web; reusing Firebase‚Äôs pair keeps one set of keys.

2) Configure Cloud Functions secrets (preferred) or env vars:
```bash
# Using Firebase Functions config
firebase functions:config:set webpush.vapid_public_key="<PUBLIC_KEY>" webpush.vapid_private_key="<PRIVATE_KEY>" webpush.contact_email="mailto:notifications@meditrax.ca"

# Or set env for local emulators
export WEB_PUSH_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY="<PUBLIC_KEY>"
export WEB_PUSH_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY="<PRIVATE_KEY>"
export WEB_PUSH_CONTACT_EMAIL="mailto:notifications@meditrax.ca"
```

3) Frontend env (.env):
```bash
# Firebase (used for FCM + callable functions)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...

# Web Push VAPID public key used for PushManager.subscribe
# You can re-use the same PUBLIC key as above
VITE_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY=<PUBLIC_KEY>

# Optional gates to enable background features
# Enable initializing Firebase Messaging inside the service worker (prod recommended)
VITE_ENABLE_SW_FIREBASE=true
# Enable anonymous Firebase Auth for backend scheduling (optional)
VITE_ENABLE_BACKEND_AUTH=true
```

4) Deploy functions after setting config:
```bash
cd functions && npm run deploy
```

Notes:
- FCM may not deliver to iOS Safari PWAs on some versions. Web Push ensures delivery on iOS (iOS 16.4+ and installed to Home Screen).
- The app will use FCM where supported (Android/desktop Chromium) and Web Push where needed (iOS/Safari).

### Inventory Units and Compatibility

- For single-inventory medications with discrete units (e.g., `capsules`) and weight-based dosing (e.g., `g` or `mg`), add a single `pillConfiguration` with the per-unit strength (e.g., `500 mg`). The app will bridge mass‚Üîdiscrete automatically for inventory updates and predictions.
- For multi-pill medications, define `pillConfigurations` and a default `doseConfiguration`; predictions use mg-based math accounting for cyclic dosing and tapering.
- Powder units (e.g., `g powder`) are treated as mass units and work with the mg-based inventory math.

### Customization
- **Colors**: Modify `tailwind.config.js` for brand colors
- **Themes**: Extend theme options in the settings page
- **Medication Categories**: Update `types/index.ts` for custom categories

## üéØ Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Create Your Profile**: Add your name and medical information in Settings
2. **Add Medications**: Use the "Add Medication" button to create your first entries
3. **Set Reminders**: Configure notification schedules for each medication
4. **Track Adherence**: Mark medications as taken or missed from the dashboard
5. **Monitor Progress**: Review analytics to track your adherence trends

### Best Practices
- **Regular Updates**: Log medications promptly for accurate tracking
- **Backup Data**: Export your data regularly for safekeeping
- **Review Analytics**: Check weekly adherence reports to identify patterns
- **Emergency Info**: Keep emergency contacts and allergy information updated

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Data Storage
- All data is stored locally in your browser
- No personal information is transmitted to external servers
- Export/import functionality allows full data control

### Privacy Features
- ~Optional anonymous usage analytics~> Disabled
- Local-only storage with no cloud sync by default
- Comprehensive data deletion options
