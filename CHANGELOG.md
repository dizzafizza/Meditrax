### 🎨 Major UI Overhaul - iOS 26 Design

**Breaking Changes:**
- Complete UI revamp to iOS 26 design language
- Migrated to Ionic React Router for native navigation
- Tabs-first navigation pattern (bottom tabs for primary destinations)
- All pages now use native Ionic components

**Added:**
- Native iOS 26 design system with SF Pro typography
- Translucent headers and tab bars with backdrop blur
- Platform-adaptive styling (iOS vs Android Material)
- Large title support with collapsing headers
- IonSearchbar for native search experience
- IonSegment controls for view modes
- Comprehensive dark mode with iOS 26 palette
- Safe area inset support for modern iOS devices
- Springy iOS-native page transitions

**Changed:**
- Router: `BrowserRouter` → `IonReactRouter` with `IonRouterOutlet`
- Navigation: Split-pane + side menu + bottom tabs architecture
- Theme: Updated to iOS 26 color palette (pure blacks, vibrant accent colors)
- Typography: SF Pro font stack with iOS-standard sizes (17px base)
- Spacing: Consistent 16px padding/margin aligned to iOS HIG
- Removed legacy `VITE_USE_IONIC_UI` feature flag (always Ionic now)

**Improved:**
- All pages wrapped in `IonPage` + `IonHeader` + `IonContent`
- Medications: Native search bar, category filters
- Calendar: Ionic segment controls for week/month views
- Better touch targets and haptic feedback integration
- Status bar and splash screen aligned to iOS 26 aesthetics

**Technical:**
- Added `@ionic/react-router@^8.7.5` dependency
- Updated `capacitor.config.ts` with iOS safe areas and status bar config
- Enhanced `src/theme/ionic.css` with comprehensive iOS 26 tokens
- Type stubs for smooth migration

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed
- Psychological Safety alerts no longer reactivate after being dismissed. Dismissals now set a cooldown window per alert key (medication:type), persisted across sessions.

### Improved
- Helpful/Not Helpful feedback now powers an intelligent ranking algorithm (Bayesian scoring) to prioritize likely-helpful alerts and temporarily suppress low-value ones.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-09-19

## [1.2.2] - 2025-09-25

## [1.3.0] - 2025-09-29

### Added
- Effects Tracker: New dedicated page to track onset, peak, and wear-off of medications and supplements with an interactive, accessible timeline UI
- Intelligent learning algorithm that calibrates per-medication effect profiles from user feedback ("kicking in", "peaking", "wearing off", "worn off")
- Dashboard integration: compact Effect Tracking card showing active sessions and real-time progress
 - Default effect durations seeded from our medications database (PsychonautWiki-derived descriptions) with parsing of onset and total duration; falls back to category heuristics
 - Category learning: learned effect timing is promoted to category-level defaults and used for new drugs within that category
 - Customization: Users can manually adjust onset/peak/wear-off/duration and save as category default; labels added to the timer

### Improved
- State persistence: Added safe deserialization for new effect sessions and profiles
 - Category defaults: Added complete default timings for all categories (opioid/kratom, benzodiazepine, stimulant, dissociative, alcohol, sleep-aid, muscle-relaxant, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, low-risk, and medication categories like supplement/herbal)
 - Database sanity checks: Guard against unrealistic parsed durations (e.g., onset > total) and fall back to category defaults automatically


### Fixed
- Dependency Prevention alerts no longer duplicate on each assessment; added merge-and-deduplicate logic with cooldowns (weekly for urgent, 3-day for pattern alerts)
- Resolved duplicate generation of Psychological Safety alerts on the dashboard by consolidating effect logic
- Calendar: Fixed "?" dose display after editing Multiple Pills configuration by preserving pill configuration IDs, and added log-time snapshots of pill strength/unit to keep historical entries accurate

### Improved
- Smart Messages are now rate-limited (max 3 per medication per 24h) and deduplicated within 12h to prevent spam
- Existing duplicate dependency alerts are collapsed on next assessment and alert history capped to last 50 items

### Added
- iOS PWA Web Push compatibility hardening: ensure VAPID subscription alongside FCM for Safari PWAs; weekly Web Push subscription health check (lightweight, non‑spamming)
- Service Worker message handlers: `STORE_REMINDER_PATTERN`, `DEACTIVATE_REMINDER_PATTERN`, `CANCEL_REMINDER_NOTIFICATIONS`, and `APP_VISIBILITY_CHANGED` to improve closed‑app delivery and reconciliation
- Backend health endpoint (`/health`) exposing VAPID configured status, Firestore access, project id, and timestamp for diagnostics
- GitHub Actions: Functions deploy workflow with Web Push config support; Pages workflow writes `.env` from Actions Variables (booleans) and Secrets (keys), includes CNAME copy and safe env presence check

### Changed
- Workbox PWA config now imports custom notification logic and Firebase messaging SW to guarantee diagnostic ping/handlers are active
- Backend token and schedule generation now deduplicate FCM tokens and only include current tokens in `scheduledNotifications`
- Backend reminder sync prunes removed reminders and prunes user FCM tokens not present in the latest sync
- Frontend backendSyncService no longer “sticks” disabled if permission wasn’t granted at first load; it re‑initializes and syncs on app load and on focus
- App boot/focus flow explicitly initializes backend, syncs data, and triggers backend scheduling for upcoming reminders
- Inventory/UI: refined Inventory page layout, dialog layering, and mobile scaling to match the shared modal pattern
- Import/Export: further hardened mapping and export (upserts, pill inventory preservation, safer date/number normalization)
- iOS Offline: improved SW caching and load timing to reduce offline blank loads when launched from Home Screen

### Fixed
- Resolved FCM token spam: frontend prefers cached token; backend deduplicates and prunes tokens; nightly stale token cleanup added
- Ensured user‑visible notifications for every push in SW (iOS requirement) and improved missed notification recovery when app regains focus
- Eliminated duplicate SW registration/import issues by consolidating imports via Workbox `importScripts`

### Improved
- iOS background notification reliability: dual‑path push (Web Push for Safari PWA, FCM for other platforms), periodic checks in SW, and consistent closed‑app scheduling via backend
- CI/CD and deployment ergonomics: environment variables handled in Pages workflow; Functions workflow manages VAPID config and deploys safely

## [1.1.2] - 2025-09-19

## [1.1.3] - 2025-09-20

### Fixed
- Inventory page now correctly detects inventory using multi‑pill data; no longer shows 0 after importing data

### Improved
- Import now upserts medications by id/name, preserves `pillInventory`, converts dates/numbers, remaps logs/reminders, and sets `pillsRemaining` from `pillInventory` for backwards compatibility
- Export respects the `includeLogs` option and includes metadata consistently
- Validation enhanced to check `pillInventory` structure and accept legacy `profile` field

### Fixed
- Inventory: Configuration dialog now reliably appears above all UI layers on the Inventory page and follows the shared modal pattern to prevent stacking issues

### Improved
- iOS Safari: Added body scroll locking and mobile-safe-area/mobile-scroll utilities to relevant modals for better WebKit behavior
- Mobile: Updated viewport meta to include `viewport-fit=cover` for proper safe-area handling on iOS devices
- Advanced Schedules: Refined Create Pattern tab with mobile-first inputs (no iOS zoom), numeric keyboard hints, and consistent spacing/components
 - Advanced Schedules: Added scrollable template categories with a larger library of cyclic dosing templates (5–2 on/off, alternate-day, 6–1, 4–3, pulse 2–5, pulse 3–4, 1w on/1w off, 21–7, 14–7, 10–20) and a quick tapering entry, aligned with app UI patterns
 - Advanced Schedules: Added Advanced templates (weekly step‑down, deload week, burst & stabilize, 3 on/1 low, reverse taper) and a collapsible Short Guide explaining how to apply and customize patterns
 - Search: Added background blur overlay on mobile and desktop, improved desktop overlay dismissal; fixed search navigation by preserving query when routing to pages; consistent glass UI on results dropdown
 - UI Theme: Subtle glass theme across surfaces (header, cards, results) using semi‑transparent backgrounds, softened borders, and backdrop blur
